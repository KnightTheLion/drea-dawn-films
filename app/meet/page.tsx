              Meet Drea â€“ North Carolina Wedding & Elopement Photographer and
              Videographer
            </h3>

            <p>
              Hi, Iâ€™m Andreaâ€”though most people know me as Drea (pronounced
              Dree-Uh)! Iâ€™m a 29-year-old wife, mama, business owner, and
              follower of Jesus, based right here in North Carolina. I'm
              passionate about capturing lifeâ€™s most meaningful moments through
              photography and film.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a proud law enforcement wife and mama to two beautiful girls,
              Mae Valentine and Knightly Dawn, I understand how fast life moves
              and how important it is to preserve the real, raw, and joyful
              moments that tell your story. At home, weâ€™re also raising a police
              K9, Henry, and two energetic German Shepherds, Zeke and Nala.
            </p>

            <p>
              I specialize in wedding photography and videographyâ€”whether youâ€™re
              planning a big celebration or an intimate mountain elopement.
              Thereâ€™s nothing more romantic than saying your vows surrounded by
              natureâ€™s beauty, and I absolutely love capturing that magic. I
              believe your wedding day should be about connection, not
              stressâ€”and Iâ€™m here to make sure your memories are documented
              beautifully.
            </p>

            <p>
              Photography runs deep in my story. Growing up in a family of
              entrepreneursâ€”my dad owns Champion Tile and was trained by his
              Amish grandfatherâ€”Iâ€™ve always been surrounded by creativity,
              craftsmanship, and heart. From a young age, I was drawn to art and
              loved sharing it with others. Now, I get to call it my full-time
              career.
            </p>

            <p>
              When we work together, youâ€™re not just a clientâ€”youâ€™re a new
              friend. Iâ€™ll be by your side to capture the real laughs, the happy
              tears, and the in-between moments youâ€™ll want to relive for a
              lifetime.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based in the Triad area of North Carolina, I proudly serve couples
              across Greensboro, Winston-Salem, High Point, and beyond.
            </p>
