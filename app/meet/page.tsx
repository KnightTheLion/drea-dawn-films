              Hi! I'm Andrea, mainly known by "Drea" (Dree-Uh). I am a 28 year
              old wife, mother, entrepreneur, and follower of Jesus.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a LEO wife, married to a wonderful man. We got married July
              14, 2016 and let me tell you- Marriage is an adventure! But I
              wouldn't trade it for anything. We are parents to our two
              beautiful daughters Mae Valentine and Knightly Dawn, and dog
              parents to two German shepherds, Zeke & Nala.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why did I choose to become a photographer? That's an easy
              question. I come from a family line based off of entrepreneurs. My
              dad, a successful business owner of Champion Tile, was raised
              under being a third generation tradesmen, he was trained under the
              eye of his Amish grandpa.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a little girl I always had a love for art, and giving that art
              to people. I never knew I could do it as a full time job!? Iâ€™m
              also a people lover, so once we connect, you will become my
              instant friend! This line of work is especially great for me,
              since I am able to work from home and raise my little Mae.
            </p>
            <p>
              I specialize in wedding photography/ videography but, If you are
              planning to elope, then by all means ELOPE!! There is nothing more
              romantic and intimate than saying your forever vows to your
              significant other on top of a sunset mountain. AH! Spend all that
              wedding money on your honeymoon and the right people to document
              your day! That's where I'd come in &#x1F609;
