        message: 'Drea, Drea, Drea. Words cannot express how good this girl is. From the initial inquiry, to the consultation, to the big day, and the delivery day, this girl has been nothing but amazing. She is kind, passionate, caring, and will be there for you like nobodies business. I remember trying to find someone to video my wedding. I wanted someone with talent but didn’t charge a fortune. When I came across Drea, it was like finding my husband, I just knew. I ultimately decided to have her photograph my wedding as well. She, and her team did an amazing job. They arrived on time. They weren’t pushy or overbearing. They were kind and gracious. During the big day Drea made my husband and I feel like models, she kind of has that way about her. Every word she speaks is kind and dripping of sweetness. She is truly talented. She puts so much time and energy into her work. She really tries to develop a friendship with each bride and groom. I cannot rave enough about her personality and her work. She made me look better than I ever thought possible. We love Drea and will continue to have her document our lives.',

Any questions we had along the way she answered immediately. On our wedding day Drea was the best with our families and making sure to capture the sweetest moments. We received our wedding video a week ago and have been teary eyed ever since-- She captured the special moments and made a seamless film. Her music selection made us all emotional and made us want more... We couldn’t have imagined having anyone else capture our special day! A huge thank you to her and all of her hard work! The  video was timeless and absolutely perfection!! :) Drea is a true professional and you will be in good hands if you hire her for your special day!',

        message: 'Goodness, where to even begin? Drea is an absolute phenomenon. Her work is beautiful and so dreamy! Drea actually videoed our engagement and after seeing it, I knew I would want her to video our wedding. Drea has the sweetest spirit and is so beautiful inside and out! When she was working on our wedding video, she would ALWAYS update me on when she was working on it and when it would be done! Making sure the music was what I wanted and all. So incredibly worth the wait. When we received our video, we had tears coming down on our faces because we felt as if we were reliving the wedding day all over again. That’s the kind of videographer you want! Someone to bring the love and happiness to life all over again. Drea is absolutely amazing to work with for sure! She arrived on time on the wedding day and was so helpful with everything. She is an absolute blessing and I’m so happy to see how God is blessing her! She keeps getting better and better and I can’t wait to see what all happens with her business. I have told so many recently engaged women that if they are looking for a photographer or videographer, to reach out to Drea because she’s awesome and extremely talented! To say that we are satisfied about Drea’s work on our video would be an understatement. Because we are more than satisfied and beyond happy!! It’s absolutely perfect. Love Drea so much!',

Never did we think that our love, the love of and for our dear family and friends could be captured in a video in such an authentic and gorgeous way. Again and again, our wedding video fills our hearts with all the emotions and indescribable bliss we have felt on our wedding day. Of all our wedding keepsakes the video is our favourite, by far. We simply cannot stop watching it. Drea is not only an amazingly talented videographer and artist but an incredible human being. She is such a joy to work with and we felt so comfortable around her. She went above and beyond for us and truly became a friend. If you are considering Drea for your wedding video - DO IT. It will be the easiest decision during wedding planning. Drea, from the bottom of our hearts: THANK YOU.',
